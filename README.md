Alternatives

advancedinterfaceoptions is an amazing addon which makes it possible to interact with every cvar in the game. I made photonz_ui because I wanted an easy way to apply my personal favourites in bulk.

You could also set these cvars in config.wtf, but I like to be able to interact with the commands easily from within the game.
