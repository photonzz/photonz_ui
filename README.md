photonz_ui is a lightweight WoW addon that enables you to quickly enable a set of useful cvars to your game with one command. 
 
I am working on expanding this list of commands
 
use /puihelp to get a list of commands, such as:

/maxfps - set the maxfps 

/nameplateOccludedAlphaMult - opacity of nameplates far away

/ShowClassColorInFriendlyNameplate - color of friendly nameplates

/puienable - enable a preset list of commands, with the following settings:

/maxfps 300 - max fps allowed by WoW

/nameplateOccludedAlphaMult 1 - never reduce opacity of nameplates

/ShowClassColorInFriendlyNameplate 0 - no class color in friendly nameplates, useful in arena

You can also interact individually with these commands.

Alternatives

advancedinterfaceoptions is an amazing addon which makes it possible to interact with every cvar in the game. I made photonz_ui because I had no way to apply all of my favourite cvars without finding them individually.

You could also set these cvars in config.wtf, but I like to be able to interact with the commands easily from within the game.
